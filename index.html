                <h2>Foundations and Background</h2>
                <p>In the Renzo Piano buildings of the High Museum of Art in Atlanta, Georgia, there are one thousand skylights overlooking many of the museum's artworks. The buildings were designed by the Renzo Piano Building Workshop (in collaboration with Lord, Aeck & Sargent Inc.) from 1999 to 2003 (<span class="italic">High Museum of Art Expansion</span>, n.d.). The Wieland Pavilion and Anne Cox Chambers Wing features these skylights (High Museum of Art, n.d.), but in the last few years, these skylights have begun leaking.</p>
                <p>Each skylight channels light from the north and into the museum below, and each skylight is partially covered by a large hood (Great Museums Television, n.d.). We have been unable to acquire high-quality and close-up images of the skylights and images of the skylights' design, but we believe there to be rubber gasket used to seal the gap between the skylight's glass and the outer structure based on images we are able to access. (We have also seen people constructing the skylights towards the end of construction, and there appears to be some kind of seal along the glass' rim.) Because of these things, we believe that the gasket has worn and become dysfunctional, supported by a guide from Bergstrom Industries that presents this explanation for skylight leakage (Naas, n.d.).</p>
                <p>We generally lack an understanding of the requirements from the High regarding possible solutions to this issue and lack assured communication with them, but we have attempted to design a solution that considers time, resources, and finances.</p>

                <h2>The Product</h2>
                <p>Because we lack high-quality images of the skylights' design, we could only make estimations of the dimensions of the skylight, and our product's design reflects this accordingly.</p>

            <div class="section-content">
                <p>Our solution is to create a replacement gasket for the skylights' glass made from silicone. This is because we do not have information about the limitations to our solution, but we believe at least sourcing replacement gaskets and having them installed to be a financially efficient and resource efficient solution that could be implemented.</p>
                <p>As for our material choice, we chose silicone because it is recommended to be highly durable in other applications. In an article from RK Brand about window seals, they say that silicone seals last for approximately fifteen to twenty years, more than the other options they speak on (Nuutinen, 2022). As a result, because of the time and monetary cost in implementing our solution (which will be explored later), we believe that our solution should have sufficient longevity to maximize its efficacy.</p>

                <h2>The Impact</h2>
                <p>Our solution will prevent leakage from the gap between the skylight and the base into the building. By preventing and creating an airtight seal around the glass, water will not be able seep through it and cause damage to the interior. The gasket will reduce the amount of work necessary to clean the inside of the museum by stopping rainwater from dripping onto the floors. It could also help prevent any possible damage to artworks displayed beneath the skylights.</p>

                <h2>Implications and Limitations</h2>
                <h3>Plan</h3>
                <p>Our solution would likely be very intensive and costly upfront, but this would prevent any troubles later on&mdash;our solution avoids the need to continue maintenance every year and should hold for the coming decades.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Remove current sealant or gasket holding glass in place. (This is where we are assuming the leak is coming from.) This will be time consuming and costly, as the manpower to remove the existing seal from the one thousand skylights will be enormous. Although, this creates the space for the next step.</li>
                    <li>The installation of the rubber stoppers: (this could be done simultaneously with the previous step) removing them and then adding them. The idea is that the mold would be snug enough to not require additional sealant to secure them, but for extra security, sealant or caulk could be used to ensure no leakage without a doubt.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Limitations: Cost and Time</h3>
                <p>These go hand-in-hand: due to not having complete measurements and a quote for a mold to mass produce, an accurate and completely feasible model of the seal could not be created. But due to the simple shape of the stopper, the cost for its creation would not be high, and they could be quickly created.</p>
                <p>Most of the cost would come from the labor required to remove the existing seal and install our solution. An article by Utah Window Experts says that replacing a window can take between two and four hours, but it can vary more depending on the window size and type (Hancock, 2024). Given this, we can make a somewhat-educated estimate on the time it would take to replace the seals for every skylight: we'll suppose that fully replacing the seals would take thirty minutes because we believe the windows to be relatively small, and we are not fully replacing the windows. Based on this and the fact that there are one thousand skylights, replacing the seals for every skylight would take five hundred hours for one person. If ten workers were to do the replacements, the time taken would be fifty hours at least; this means that even with ten people working, more than an average work week of time would be sacrificed. Thus, this time and cost to replace the seals would be significant. However, because of the longevity of our proposed solution, we believe that the implementation would be worthwhile.</p>

                <h2>User Reaction</h2>
                <p>Here are some questions for Mrs. McLeod at the High related to our possible product idea:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What are the dimensions of the glass in each skylight or the dimensions of the existing seal around the glass?</li>
                    <li>What funds and resources could be allocated to implementing our solution (something that involves servicing every skylight)?</li>

                <h3>Objective and Learning Experience</h3>
                <p>The objective of this project was to effectively utilize the design thinking process to develop some kind of solution to a problem that the High Museum of Art faces. We were given several problems to choose from to address, and chose the issue of skylights leaking in the Renzo Piano buildings at the museum. We aimed to create (at least) a design for a product that could help alleviate this issue. We began ideating as soon as we had learned some information, and as we were able to ideate more solid ideas as we learned more about the problem.</p>
                <h3>Initial Process</h3>
                <p>After we selected the problem we wanted to address, we first researched information about the skylights at the museum, and at the same time, we had some ideas for solutions based on the information given to us in the problem synposes. We found that we were not able to acquire specific information about the skylights like their dimensions or materials, but we did gain an idea into their structure, and this founded our later ideas for solutions. Through this process, we came to current solution of a new rubber gasket for the skylights' glass. In addition, we researched what would be an appropriate material for the seal and what would be the best in terms of longevity. With that information, we attempted to find quotes for the manufacturing of our product, but we did not receive responses in time.</p>
                <h3>Feedback and Revisions</h3>
